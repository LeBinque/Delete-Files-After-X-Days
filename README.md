# Delete-Files-Alter-X-Days
Deleting files (for example jpg from webcam) after a number of days.

I have a webcam at home, making a snapshot every 20 seconds. These JPGs are saved on an old laptop/server-thing. After a few days i have thousands of JPGs.
Searching the internet (and not finding) for some software to delete them, i decided to build my own.

I'm not a great programmer, but this works for me. And maybe this can also help others.

No installation required. You only need the exe. Just put the exe somewhere. 
After first run, the program will create an ini-file.

Manual run the program. Buttons are self-explained (i think).

To force auto-run: call it with ANY parameter. So for example:
DeleteFilesAfterXDays.exe /banana

What i did is make a shortcut for this program, with parameter, and have the windows Task-Scheduler start this shortcut every day.

If you like this program, send me an email! a underscore lebbink at hotmail dot com
- sourcecode (C#) in zip

Update 7-3-2016 - some changes made to program , first upload to GitHub. Still need to do more tests.
